## Getting-Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version 22.12.0 or newer is required.
- A Discord bot (you can crate a Discord bot via the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- A MongoDB database
---
### Installation
1. Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Takkapi/discord-bot-template.git
cd discord-bot-template
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Modify the `config.json` file in the `data` folder
```json
{
  "token": "YOUR-PRODUCTION-BOT-TOKEN",
  "discordClientId": "YOUR-PRODUCTION-BOT-CLIENT-ID",
  "mongoUrl": "YOUR-MONGODB-URL",

  "devToken": "YOUR-DEVELOPMENT-BOT-TOKEN",
  "devDiscordClientId": "YOUR-DEVELOPMENT-BOT-CLIENT-ID",
  "devGuildId": "YOUR-DEVELOPMENT-GUILD-ID",
  "developerUserIds": ["YOUR-USER-ID"],
  "devMongoUrl": "YOUR-DEVELOPMENT-MONGODB-URL"
}
```
All the fields dev related can be ignored if you only have one Discord bot
4. Start the bot:
```bash
npm run start
```

If everything goes right, you should see this output in your terminal
```output

If you're using VS Code, I implemented a snippet for creating a command and subcommand faster without copy-pasting or rewriting the code over and over again. The `Test.ts`, `Test.One.ts`, `Test.Two.ts` serve as an example for creating subcommands and `Dev.ts` serve as an example for creating commands.
